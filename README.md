<h1>Sugiyama Graph Layout</h1>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>F#</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Sugiyama Graph Layout project is a application developed using F# in the .NET Framework. It was written using a pure functional style of programming which prioritises the use of higher order functions instead of traditional stateful features of imperative programming styles. The application takes a suite of tests which include a set of nodes and edges which connect them together. It then uses various functions to apply a heuristic ordering algorithm in order to minimise the amount of edge crossings and the result is calculated using the F# Flips Library. The output is an image of the optomised directed acyclic graph.</p>
